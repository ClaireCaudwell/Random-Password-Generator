# Random Password Generator ðŸ”‘
Practising my JavaScript skills and decided to create a random password generator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ascii code and RegExp. 

Password is 12 characters long and is a random mix of numbers, upper and lowercase letters and special charachters based on the Ascii table between number 33 and 126.
